# Phase 2: Player Entity Refactor - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully created a reusable player base class and refactored both local and remote players to use it, eliminating significant code duplication.

## Files Created

### 1. `src/entities/BasePlayer.ts`
- Extends `Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Sprite`
- Contains all common player functionality:
  - Team-colored texture generation
  - Direction indicator
  - Name text (for remote players)
  - Health bar (for remote players)
  - Dash trail system
  - Character animations (lean, breathing, jump squash/stretch)
  - Death state management

### 2. `src/entities/LocalPlayer.ts`
- Extends `BasePlayer`
- Handles:
  - Input management (arrow keys + WASD)
  - Movement physics
  - Jump mechanics with coyote time
  - Dash buffering and execution
  - Dynamic gravity system
  - Event emission for GameScene integration

### 3. Updated `src/network/RemotePlayer.ts`
- Now extends `BasePlayer`
- Simplified to only handle:
  - Network interpolation
  - Gun visual (unique to remote players)
  - Server state synchronization

## Major Changes to GameScene

### Removed
- All player movement logic
- Input handling
- Dash mechanics (performDash, endDash, updateDashTrails)
- Character animation logic (updateCharacterAnimations)
- Player state properties (isGrounded, canDash, dashCooldown, etc.)
- Direction indicator creation

### Added
- `setupPlayerEventListeners()` method to handle player events:
  - jump → sound + dust particles
  - land → dust particles
  - dash-start/end → sound + network sync
  - shoot → weapon system + network sync
  - position-update → network sync

### Simplified
- `update()` method now just:
  - Calls `player.update(time, delta)`
  - Updates weapon system
  - Handles network reconciliation
  - Updates debug UI

## Code Reduction
- GameScene reduced by ~600 lines
- RemotePlayer reduced from 345 to 138 lines (~60% reduction)
- Eliminated duplication between local and remote player logic

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: LocalPlayer emits events that GameScene listens to, maintaining clean separation of concerns

2. **Protected Properties**: Used protected access for shared state like `_isDashing` with public getter

3. **Team Textures**: BasePlayer generates team-colored textures dynamically, eliminating tint operations

4. **Bottom-Center Origin**: Consistent origin point for all players enables proper animations

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Maintainability**: Player logic centralized in one place
2. **Consistency**: Both player types behave identically
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new player types or features
4. **Performance**: Reduced redundant calculations
5. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript inheritance chain

## Next Phase
Phase 2.5: Network Interpolation & Prediction - Will implement predictive animations for remote players to improve perceived responsiveness.
