# Phase 3: Movement System Extraction - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully extracted all movement logic into a dedicated MovementSystem, making it reusable and testable. The system is now decoupled from player entities and can be used by any game object.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. `MovementSystem` (src/systems/MovementSystem.ts)
The heart of the movement logic:
- **Physics calculations**: Acceleration, friction, max speed
- **Jump mechanics**: Including coyote time for forgiving jumps
- **Dash system**: Direction calculation, velocity application, gravity control
- **Dynamic gravity**: Different gravity values for different movement states
- **Ground detection**: Tracks grounded state for jumps and dashes

Key features:
- Completely decoupled from entities
- Works with any Phaser physics body
- State-based design for easy debugging
- Pure functions where possible

#### 2. `MovementController` (src/systems/MovementController.ts)
A convenience wrapper that adds:
- Event-driven architecture (onJump, onLand, onDashStart, onDashEnd)
- State change detection
- Simplified API for common use cases
- Built-in edge detection for state transitions

#### 3. Refactored `LocalPlayer`
Now much simpler:
- Handles input gathering
- Uses MovementSystem for all physics
- Emits events for GameScene
- Manages animations based on movement state

#### 4. Example `AIPlayer`
Demonstrates system reusability:
- Three AI behaviors: Aggressive, Defensive, Patrol
- Uses MovementController for physics
- Shows how non-player entities can use the same movement system

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Movement logic is no longer tied to player implementation
- Input handling separate from physics
- Animation separate from movement

### 2. **Reusability**
- Same system works for players, AI, and potentially other entities
- Easy to create different movement behaviors
- Can be unit tested independently

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Movement bugs can be fixed in one place
- Easy to tweak physics values
- Clear interfaces and responsibilities

### 4. **Extensibility**
- Easy to add new movement features
- Can create custom movement controllers
- AI behaviors can be mixed and matched

## Code Structure

```
src/
├── systems/
│   ├── MovementSystem.ts      # Core physics and movement
│   └── MovementController.ts  # Event-driven wrapper
├── entities/
│   ├── BasePlayer.ts         # Visual representation
│   ├── LocalPlayer.ts        # Input + MovementSystem
│   ├── RemotePlayer.ts       # Network interpolation
│   └── AIPlayer.ts           # AI behaviors + MovementSystem
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **State-based Architecture**: Movement state is explicit and trackable
2. **Input Abstraction**: MovementInput interface allows any input source
3. **Event System**: Controllers emit events for game integration
4. **No Direct Coupling**: System works with physics bodies, not specific entities

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Create system
const movementSystem = new MovementSystem(scene);
const state = MovementSystem.createMovementState();

// In update loop
const input = gatherInput(); // From keyboard, AI, network, etc.
movementSystem.updateMovement(body, input, state, deltaTime);
```

## Future Possibilities

1. **Custom Movement Types**: Wall jumping, climbing, swimming
2. **Movement Modifiers**: Speed boosts, slow zones, different gravities
3. **Recording/Replay**: State can be serialized for replays
4. **Predictive Movement**: Can simulate future states for AI planning

## Migration Guide

For existing entities to use MovementSystem:
1. Remove physics code from entity
2. Create MovementSystem instance
3. Gather input into MovementInput structure
4. Call updateMovement in update loop
5. React to state changes as needed

## Performance Considerations

- System is lightweight with minimal allocations
- State objects can be pooled if needed
- Most calculations are simple arithmetic
- No complex collision detection (handled by Phaser)

## Next Phase
Phase 4: Animation System - Will create a dedicated AnimationSystem to handle all character animations based on movement state.
