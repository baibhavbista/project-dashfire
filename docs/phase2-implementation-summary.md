# Phase 2 Implementation Summary - Character Personality

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. **Direction Indicator**
- Small triangle above each player (like Thomas)
- Points in the direction of movement (left/right)
- Team colored to match player
- Fades to 30% opacity when stationary
- Scales up and brightens during dash
- Works for both local and remote players

### 2. **Breathing Animation**
- Subtle idle animation when stationary
- Scales from 98% to 102% with sine easing
- 1.5 second cycle for natural feel
- Automatically stops when moving
- Resumes when player becomes idle again

### 3. **Movement Animations**
- **Lean Effect**: 5¬∞ rotation based on horizontal velocity
- **Jump Stretch**: 90% width, 110% height when ascending
- **Fall Compress**: 110% width, 90% height when descending
- **Landing Squash**: Dramatic 130% width, 70% height with elastic bounce-back

### 4. **Animation States**
All animations smoothly transition between states:
- Idle ‚Üí Breathing + upright stance
- Moving ‚Üí Lean + no breathing
- Jumping ‚Üí Stretch + maintain lean
- Falling ‚Üí Compress + maintain lean
- Landing ‚Üí Squash effect overrides other animations
- Dashing ‚Üí Reset to neutral (no deformation)

## üéÆ Visual Impact

The rectangles now feel alive with personality:
- They "breathe" when resting
- They lean into their movement
- They stretch and compress with physics
- They have a satisfying "bounce" on landing
- The direction indicator adds intentionality

## üîß Technical Implementation

### New Properties Added:
```typescript
// GameScene & RemotePlayer
- directionIndicator: Triangle shape
- breathingTween: Tween animation
- lastVelocityX: Direction memory
- isGrounded/wasGrounded: Landing detection
- landingSquashTween: Landing animation
```

### Key Methods:
- `startBreathingAnimation()` - Initiates idle breathing
- `stopBreathingAnimation()` - Halts breathing for movement
- `updateCharacterAnimations()` - Main animation controller
- `createLandingSquash()` - Landing impact effect

## üìù Notes

- All animations respect team colors
- Remote players mirror local player animations
- Performance impact is minimal (simple transforms)
- Animations make the rectangles feel like characters, not just shapes

## üöÄ Ready for Phase 3

The character personality is now established. Phase 3 will add:
- Enhanced particle effects
- Death shatter animation
- Glow/lighting effects
- More polish to complete the Thomas Was Alone aesthetic
