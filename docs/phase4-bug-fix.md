# Phase 4 Bug Fix: Player Visibility Issue

## Problem
After implementing the Animation System, the player became invisible and threw this error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'clearDashTrails')
    at LocalPlayer.setPosition (LocalPlayer.ts:236:30)
```

## Root Cause
The issue occurred because:
1. Phaser's `Sprite` constructor calls `setPosition` internally during initialization
2. Our `LocalPlayer.setPosition` override was trying to access `this.animationController`
3. But `animationController` is created AFTER the `super()` call completes
4. This created a timing issue where `setPosition` was called before `animationController` existed

## Solution
Added a null check in `LocalPlayer.setPosition`:
```typescript
// Clear any animations (only if controller exists - may be called during construction)
if (this.animationController) {
  this.animationController.clearDashTrails();
}
```

## Key Lesson
When overriding Phaser methods that might be called during construction, always check if your custom properties exist before using them. Phaser's internal initialization process may call various methods before your constructor completes.

## Timeline
1. `new LocalPlayer()` called
2. `super()` (BasePlayer constructor) called
3. BasePlayer calls `super()` (Phaser.Sprite constructor)
4. Phaser.Sprite internally calls `setPosition` ‚Üê Error happened here
5. Rest of BasePlayer constructor runs (creates animationController)
6. Rest of LocalPlayer constructor runs

The fix ensures `setPosition` can be safely called at any point in the object lifecycle.
